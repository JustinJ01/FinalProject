    "# Final Project: Sporting Game Outcome Prediction\n",
    "## Data Loading and Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This initial section focuses on setting up the environment and defining functions to load and transform the raw play-by-play data into a usable format for game outcome prediction. We will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Import Libraries:** Bring in essential libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib/seaborn for visualization, and various modules from scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation.\n",
    "* **Define `load_and_process_data` Function:** Create a function to handle a single CSV file. This function will:\n",
    "    * Read the play-by-play data.\n",
    "    * Identify unique teams and attempt robust home/away team assignment (checking for `IsHome` or similar columns, falling back to approximation if needed).\n",
    "    * Iterate through each game, accumulating team statistics (yards, attempts, turnovers, penalties, scores, etc.) by processing individual plays.\n",
    "    * Calculate game-level differential features (e.g., `yards_diff`, `turnovers_diff`, `ypa_diff`) which often provide strong predictive signals.\n",
    "    * Determine the game winner based on simplified score calculation (to be used as the target variable).\n",
    "    * Return a pandas DataFrame where each row represents a single game with its aggregated stats and differentials.\n",
    "* **Define `combine_data_multiple_years` Function:** Create a helper function to apply `load_and_process_data` to multiple yearly CSV files and concatenate the results into a single DataFrame.\n",
    "* **Handle Warnings:** Suppress convergence and user warnings for cleaner output during potentially long computations like grid search."
